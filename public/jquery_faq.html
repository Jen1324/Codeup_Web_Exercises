 <h1>Parks List</h1>
    
    <h3>National Parks</h3>
        <h3>Arches</h3>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Today people visit Arches for the views and trails. Those who came before sought many other things: wealth, adventure, solitude, or a home.</li>
        		<li>Rock doesn't retain the footprints of its travelers, so there aren't many places where Arches' human story is evident. Two popular spots showcase very different stories written on the land.</li>
        		<li>This park contains more than 2,000 natural arches</li>
        		<li>Perched high above the Colorado River, the park is part of southern Utah's extended canyon country, carved and shaped by eons of weathering and erosion. </li>
        	</ul>

        <h3>Badlands</h3>
        	<ul>
        		<li>They call it The Wall. It extends for a hundred miles through the dry plains of South Dakota—a huge natural barrier ridging the landscape, sculptured into fantastic pinnacles and tortuous gullies by the forces of water.</li>
        		<li>Badlands National Park is considered home to one of the world's richest deposits of mammal fossil beds.</li>
        		<li>The Oglala Lakota Nation, the second-largest American Indian Reservation in the United States, co-manages half of Badlands National Park.</li>
        		<li>The Badlands average one inch of erosion per year.</li>
        	</ul>

        <h3>Carlsbad Caverns</h3>
        	<ul>
        		<li>The Carlsbad Caverns form one of the world's oldest cave systems, and according to National Park Service statistics, receive around 300,000 visitors per year.</li>
        		<li>The caverns lie approximately 27 miles from the city of Carlsbad in the Guadalupe Mountains, New Mexico, beneath the Chihuahuan Desert.</li>
        		<li>The rugged landscape of the Carlsbad Caverns National Park conceals 117 known caves, including vast underground chambers.</li>
        		<li>The Guadalupe Mountains were formed around 20 million years ago when tectonic activity forced a gigantic limestone reef to rise from an inland sea.</li>
        	</ul>

        <h3>Denali</h3>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Denali National Park is the site of the highest peak on the continent of North America.</li>
        		<li>As you make your way through Denali National Park, you will be following in the footsteps of humans tracing back to the last Ice Age 12,000 years ago.</li>
        		<li>Mt. McKinley is the most famous attraction in the park, but you may not be experienced enough to climb to the peak.</li>
        		<li>Much contemporary knowledge about the behavior of wolves came from studying the animals in Denali National Park.</li>
        	</ul>

        <h3>Everglades</h3>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Everglades National Park in Florida encompasses a combination of habitats that together make up an extraordinary and valuable ecosystem.</li>
        		<li>The Everglades, called the River of Grass because the area is largely a river sometimes 60 miles wide, is not a marsh or swamp. Native Americans called it pahayokee, or the grassy waters.</li>
        		<li>The ecosystem protects 14 endangered and nine threatened species, including the Florida panther, the Atlantic Ridley turtle and the American crocodile.</li>
        		<li>The dominant life form in the national park is periphyton, a combination of algae and microbes that floats on the surface of most of the bodies of water.</li>
        	</ul>
